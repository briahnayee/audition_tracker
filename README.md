#Audition Tracker

###It is so important for actors to stay organized, especially when it come to auditions. Actors must remember what casting directors they've met, their booking ratio, and what projects they have read for. The best way to do this is to keep an audition log. Audition tracker is an easy way for actors to log and organize their auditions.

###Technologies Used:
React, Node, PostgreSQL, JavaScript, HTML, CSS

###Getting Started:
Create an account and login. Create a new audition to add to your table by clicking the "New Audition" button. Fill in the form and click submit to add the audition to your table. 
Trello board: https://trello.com/b/pSktnDNZ/project-4 

###Next Steps:
In the future I would like to allow the user to add callbacks to a single audition. I would also like them to be able to see their booking ratio and callback ratio at the top on the Auditions page. I would also like to give the user the option to embed a self-tape link into a single audition to keep track of their past self tapes. One last icebox item would be allowing the user to look up a casting director and see all the auditions that they have had for that specific casting director.
